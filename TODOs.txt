- requestor only works on happy path. no HTTP/connection/DNS error handling
- stream media bytes directly to client instead of current "store and forward"

Landing page:
    - Random articles in topcis?

Better montage support? Perhaps a new media type that has multiple images but just one caption?
    Signal (software) has a montage box with single captions per image. Should support this


Better Rendering:

- don't add links to list unless its a "See Also"
- add "related articles" into content (separate page?)
- Add most popular links
- Better selection of default video type (lots of devices can't do ogg, etc)
- support more languages
- table horizontal lines don't have "+" in right place for colspans
- Article name is wrong (IPad instead of iPad). This is because of the API I am using



- Rendering bugs:
    - Empty list entries (Karl Marx infobox)
    - tables nested inside tables (Vietnam administrative districts)

Infobox:
    - handle places that use single row tables as multi columns (band album chronologies use this to show prev, curren and next album
	
Geography:
Add "Search for articles near X" feature on main page
