Features:

- requestor only works on happy path. no HTTP/connection/DNS error handling
- stream media bytes directly to client instead of current "store and forward"
- Definitions via Wikitionary: https://en.wiktionary.org/api/rest_v1/#/Page%20content/get_page_definition__term_
- Landing page:
    - Random articles in topcis?

Better Rendering:
- don't add links to list unless its a "See Also"
- add "related articles" into content (separate page?)
- Better selection of default video type (lots of devices can't do ogg, etc)
- table horizontal lines don't have "+" in right place for colspans
- Article name is wrong (IPad instead of iPad). This is because of the API I am using

Rendering bugs:
    - Empty list entries (Karl Marx infobox)
    - tables nested inside tables (Vietnam administrative districts)

"Sources" section not removed
    - "apollo" article

Blockquote bug:
    "Hercule Poirot" in "Appearance and proclivities"

Infobox:
    - handle places that use single row tables as multi columns (band album chronologies use this to show prev, curren and next album
