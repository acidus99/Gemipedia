- <Math> elements not supported

- requestor only works on happy path. no HTTP/connection/DNS error handling
- Converter control options
- stream media bytes directly to client instead of current "store and forward"
- caching shim for media/articles

- Use actual MIME type based on file extension, actual filename for proxied media

Better Rendering:

	
- Use the 2x thumbnail?

-Title as link sometimes fails for going to wikipedia
	e.g. "Military+tactics" vs "Military_tactics"

- Tables need better parsing. Right now the "TR" query finds tables inside of the table!

- Tables => ASCII tables


COMPLETE:
- Organize referenced links by section
	don't show duplicates of links that appear in more than 1 section
- image gallery
- Don't show a section if it doesn't have any content
	(or it only has a navigation link to something else)
