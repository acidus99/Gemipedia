Landing page:
     - Most popular articles API
    - Better Search API
        (show summaries, not sippets of search text
    - Show news storeis based on Wikipedia front page

    - Random articles in topcis?



Better Rendering:

- don't add links to list unless its a "See Also"
- add "related articles" into content (separate page?)
- Add most popular links
- Better selection of defalt video type (lots of devices can't do ogg, etc)
- support more languages
- table horizontal lines don't have "+" in right place for colspans
- Article name is wrong (IPad instead of iPad). This is because of the API I am using
- links inside of lists can be wrong since they are not started on a new line. See "IPad 2"


Infobox:
    - Find Geohack coorindates and display them. Map View!
    - better handle tables (WW II article)
    - handle places that use single row tables as multi columns (band album chronologies use this to show prev, curren and next album
