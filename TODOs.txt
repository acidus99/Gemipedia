- requestor only works on happy path. no HTTP/connection/DNS error handling
- Converter control options
- stream media bytes directly to client instead of current "store and forward"
- caching shim for media/articles
- Use actual MIME type based on file extension, actual filename for proxied media

Better Rendering:

- don't add links to list unless its a "See Also"
- add "related articles" into content (separate page?)
- Add most popular links
- Better selection of defalt video type (lots of devices can't do ogg, etc)
- support more languages
- table horizontal lines don't have "+" in right place for colspans
- Article name is wrong (IPad instead of iPad). This is because of the API I am using
- links inside of lists can be wrong since they are not started on a new line. See "IPad 2"
